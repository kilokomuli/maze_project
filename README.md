# Tasks

# 0.Walls!
In this first part, you’ll have to:

Create a window with SDL2
Use [raycasting](https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/) to draw walls on your window !
You don’t need to be able to rotate the camera during the execution in this part, but you must provide a way to change the angle of the camera in your code to see if it works after recompiling it
The color of the walls must be different from the color of the ground/ceil
The map doesn’t need to be parsed from a file, but you must provide a way to modify it in your code to see if it works after recompiling it. (e.g. using an array of arrays of integers or characters).
